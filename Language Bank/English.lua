Welcome to Stars of Fate, a ROBLOX fighting game based on and inspired by Hirohiko Araki's manga: Jojo's Bizarre Adventure!
With this guide, you will gain an understanding of this game's fighting mechanics and skillsets.
To navigate, simply use the buttons on the left of this menu to view details of abilities and this guide. You can use the buttons on the right to view the specific contents of the index.
You can select a new ability by pressing the arrowhead button on the top left of your screen.
If this is your first time playing, it is recommended to view the tutorial contents before getting yourself shredded by someone who has.
]];
	guide_tutorial_controls = [[
All buttons listed are the default buttons you start with, most of these can be changed in the controls settings. You also have access to a handful of keybind profiles you can cycle through in the controls settings.
(In order to play with a gamepad, you will need to go into settings and assign buttons manually)

Movement: WASD (PC), Bottom Left Joystick (Mobile), Left Joystick (Gamepad)
Close Quarters: M1, E, R, T
Specials: F, G, H
Ranged: V, B
Mobility: Z
Block: X
Dodge: C
Run: Left Ctrl
Shift Lock: Left Shift

Keep in mind that some skillsets will diverge from the naming conventions of the buttons (the Boxing skillset is effectively entirely close quarters, for example), but every skillset utilizes every button listed in some way.
]];
	guide_tutorial_cards = [[
You may have noticed a number flashed in the bottom left corner of your screen after pressing a button randomly. The button you pressed requires this card to be equal to or greater than the number that flashes to activate the move on the button.
In order to increase the card number, you must fill up the bar next to the card by dealing or taking damage from enemies. You can hold up to 10 cards at a time. Your card amount does not reset when your character respawns, but the bar does.
Once you activate the move you wanted to see earlier with enough cards, it will consume the cards it flashed earlier so be sure to only use those skills at the right opportunity.
]];
	guide_tutorial_stamina = [[
Stamina affects many aspects of your character and is just as important as your character's health. Stamina is used for running, blocking, and dodging.
Be sure to utilize running for closing distance between you and your opponent. Using it constantly in a fight is a bad use of stamina and you will run out very quickly. However when you are out of combat, you can run around freely without consuming stamina. Your combat indicator is the colorful accent surrounding your character puppet in the top left of your screen. If it is red, it means you are combat tagged.
While running, be sure not to look directly away from your opponent. The stamina loss from running will be increased drastically and can quickly stop you in your tracks if you are not careful.
When your character starts to sweat, it means you are low on stamina and need to recover quickly. While sweating, you take increased damage from attackers.
Your stamina gradually recovers when you're not running and blocking, and won't start recovering for a moment after running.
]];
	guide_tutorial_blocking = [[
By holding your block key, you cover yourself in a bubble. The bubble will completely reduce damage from most attacks. Some attacks can bypass or break the bubble entirely, so be cautious of these attacks.
If your stamina reaches 0 while blocking, your bubble will crash and you will become dizzy, leaving yourself open to super dangerous attacks. It is not wise to block when your stamina is low.
You can time your block right before getting attacked to perform a parry. Parrying steals cards from the enemy you countered and restores your stamina by the amount of damage the attack would've otherwise dealt.
It's not the end of the world if you mistime a parry. Assuming you did not crash from blocking the attack, you can let go of Block right after the attack to skip the blocking end-lag which will allow you to quickly punish the attacker.
]];
	guide_tutorial_dodging = [[
Dodging is your most consistent option for weaving around an opponent, as it is both instant and briefly grants full invincibility to attacks.
You can dodge while moving to perform a dash, which will push you into the same direction you are moving, allowing for quick repositioning. Keep in mind that you cannot redirect your dash, so be ready to commit to the movement.
Be mindful of your stamina while dodging, however. If you are sweating, you will not gain any invincibility to attacks while dashing. If you have less than 10% of stamina, you will trip over yourself instead.
]];
	guide_tutorial_recovery = [[
Some attacks will cause you to completely fall over and ragdoll. After hitting the ground in this ragdoll state, most attacks are unable to hit you until you get back up.
You can get back up faster after getting knocked down by pressing the Dodge button, which will also briefly grant you invincibility to attacks. If you are holding a movement key while pressing the Dodge button, you will roll into the direction your movement is pointing towards. Being able to get back up quickly is a very important skill to have, as it lets you escape otherwise deadly combos.
Timing your quick get-up is important too, as your invincibility is only brief. Using it right before an attack can let you turn the fight around in your favor.
Don't forget that quick get-up shares the same cooldown as your dodge move, so you can utilize this often.
]];
	guide_tutorial_privateservers = [[
Private servers are the ultimate way to get a feel for the game and try out newly released content. By owning a private server, you gain access to many commands to assist with your experiments. To check your commands, press the "</>" button on the top of your screen and input "help".
Private servers also spawn a variety of dummies, some with unique properties that can help you gain a better understand of skillsets. Private servers have been and will always be free so don't be afraid to try them out.

A combination of power and speed, Crazy Diamond uses its flexible kit and powerful strikes to attack and defend almost simultaneously.
Crazy Diamond's primary ability is restoration, which can restore an object to a previous state (unless its target has already passed). If used improperly, Crazy Diamond can also disfigure an object.
Crazy Diamond is a fairly basic ability, with a kit designed to be a hybrid between offense and defense, having certain attacks that can keep the user protected whilst attacking. It is a quick striker akin to Star Platinum: The World and Whitesnake, with its most unique ability being the existence of Rage Mode when reaching low health, unlocking an enraged moveset mildly resembling Star Platinum's slower but more powerful style.
The key to this ability is mastering combining raw skills with regular M1's situationally in order to punish slip-ups.

Strategic, calculated, and perhaps most importantly, blessed, D4C displays particular finesse over powerful combos and high damage potential.
D4C's primary ability is to travel to parallel dimensions by sandwiching between two objects (typically via the user's trusty flag). The same objects from parallel worlds cannot coexist, and will attempt to re-fuse itself but result in a catostrophe. However, D4C and its user are the exception to this rule, allowing the two to travel freely.
D4C is a highly technical ability, requiring a decent amount of skill to be wielded competently. It specializes in combo potential, utilizing Ultimate Cards beyond all else to fuel its devastating combos, as well as requiring them to activate its awakening, D4C: Love Train.
The key to mastering this ability is generally improving on your ability to win M1 exchanges, as it is highly reliant on combos in order to deal significant damage rather than being able to balance it with raw use skills. Knowing the right time to spend your Ultimate Cards is also crucial.

Cunning and opportunistic, Whitesnake uses its arsenal to punish wide openings in aggressive opponents and bait them into attacks that leave the victim vulnerable.
Whitesnake has two main abilities: ejecting someone's properties into a disc (Stands, personalities, vision, etc.) and putting targets into a coma with goo. Whitesnake also has its own personality and consciousness, allowing it to operate at full capacity decently far way from its user.
Whitesnake is a mild difficulty ability, requiring more mastery to use effectively compared to other abilities. It is quite fast in close quarters, and can be difficult to anticipate.
The ideal way to wield this ability is to use your fast skills to take your enemy by surprise, perhaps purposely missing some of your safest moves in order to bait the victim into trying to retaliate, countering with a well-timed attack or counter.

With its unrivaled agility and fearsome striking power, Boxing specializes in going in the offensive, pushing opponents until they falter.
Boxing is among the simplest available abilities mechanically, but demands a comparably much more aggressive and active playstyle in order to take advantage of its speed. It is nearly as competent at punishing blocking enemies as Star Platinum, yet is quicker, but with significantly shorter range. Boxing's unique ability is a special dash intended to be harder to predict and react to, and increased meter gain from all sources.
The key to success is overcoming the handicap of your reduced range, learning to juggle opponents in the air, and relying greatly on M1's granted it is a heavily combo-oriented ability.
